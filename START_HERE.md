```

### Adjust Training Parameters
```python
# In train_or_finetune.ipynb
TRAINING_CONFIG = {
    'num_epochs': 10,         # More epochs
    'batch_size': 16,         # Larger batch
    'learning_rate': 5e-5,    # Lower learning rate
}
```

### Add Multi-Language Support

# In train_or_finetune.ipynb
TRAINING_CONFIG['language'] = 'hi'  # Hindi
# Supported: 'en', 'es', 'fr', 'de', 'hi', 'zh', etc.
```

### Upload to HuggingFace

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### GPU Not Detected
```
Solution: Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU (T4)
Then restart runtime
```

### Out of Memory Error
```
Solution: In train_or_finetune.ipynb
Set TRAINING_CONFIG['batch_size'] = 4  # or 2
The system also auto-reduces batch size on OOM
```

### Dataset Download Fails
```
Solution 1: Check internet connection
Solution 2: Download LJSpeech manually from:
https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/
Upload to Google Drive
```

### Import Errors
```
Solution: Re-run setup.ipynb
All dependencies will be reinstalled
```

### Gradio Not Loading
```
Solution: Make sure you're in Google Colab
demo.launch(share=True) creates public URL
```
